      "summary": "Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise\nin generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming\ncharacters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows\nplayers to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite\ncharacters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are\ndefined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and\nfixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through\nopen-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments.\nRecently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs\nlarge language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into\nlanguage instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical\nvisual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only\ngenerates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an\nengaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built\nupon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state,\nincluding dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates\nto character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel\naction-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can\nbe decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By\ntaking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting\nsubsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual\nconsistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both\nautomated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms\nexisting methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

    "title": "AnimeGamer: Infinite Anime Life Simulation with Next Game State\n  Prediction",
    "summary": "Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise\nin generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming\ncharacters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows\nplayers to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite\ncharacters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are\ndefined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and\nfixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through\nopen-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments.\nRecently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs\nlarge language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into\nlanguage instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical\nvisual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only\ngenerates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an\nengaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built\nupon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state,\nincluding dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates\nto character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel\naction-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can\nbe decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By\ntaking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting\nsubsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual\nconsistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both\nautomated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms\nexisting methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

We propose a\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid\nguidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control\nsignals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D\nbody skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements,\nwhile producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale\nadaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from\nportraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using\ndata with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate\nmotion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references,\nensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex\nmovements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits,\nupper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency.

      "summary": "We present ILLUME+ that leverages dual visual tokenization and a diffusion\ndecoder to improve both deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image\ngeneration. Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the\nthree fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation,\nand editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image\ndiscretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind\nspecialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this,\nLaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle\nwith image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series\ndecouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities\nto seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In\ncontrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which\npreserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling\na coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and\ngeneration. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer\nfor enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows\na continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a\nprogressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the\nvision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible\nand efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks.\nILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs\nand specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing\nbenchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and\nversatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page:\nhttps://illume-unified-mllm.github.io/.",

    "title": "ILLUME+: Illuminating Unified MLLM with Dual Visual Tokenization and\n  Diffusion Refinement",
    "summary": "We present ILLUME+ that leverages dual visual tokenization and a diffusion\ndecoder to improve both deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image\ngeneration. Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the\nthree fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation,\nand editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image\ndiscretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind\nspecialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this,\nLaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle\nwith image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series\ndecouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities\nto seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In\ncontrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which\npreserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling\na coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and\ngeneration. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer\nfor enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows\na continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a\nprogressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the\nvision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible\nand efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks.\nILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs\nand specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing\nbenchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and\nversatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page:\nhttps://illume-unified-mllm.github.io/.",
