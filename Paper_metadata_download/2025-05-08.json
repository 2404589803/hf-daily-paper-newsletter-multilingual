Recent research has\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities\nby interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these\napproaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)\nUncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search\nengines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the\ntraining process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of\nLLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B\nLLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves\ncomparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module\neven surpasses it.

      "summary": "Customized video generation aims to produce videos featuring specific\nsubjects under flexible user-defined conditions, yet existing methods often\nstruggle with identity consistency and limited input modalities. In this paper,\nwe propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework\nthat emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and\ntext conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the\nimage-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion\nmodule based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an\nimage ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce\nidentity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned\ngeneration, we further propose modality-specific condition injection\nmechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial\ncross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates\nlatent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios\ndemonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-\nand closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video\nalignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks,\nincluding audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results\nhighlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving\nstrategies in advancing controllable video generation.

    "summary": "Customized video generation aims to produce videos featuring specific\nsubjects under flexible user-defined conditions, yet existing methods often\nstruggle with identity consistency and limited input modalities. In this paper,\nwe propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework\nthat emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and\ntext conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the\nimage-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion\nmodule based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an\nimage ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce\nidentity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned\ngeneration, we further propose modality-specific condition injection\nmechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial\ncross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates\nlatent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios\ndemonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-\nand closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video\nalignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks,\nincluding audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results\nhighlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving\nstrategies in advancing controllable video generation.

The expressiveness, soundness and\ncompleteness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on\nproblem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500\nbenchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP\nbenchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and\nhuman-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional\nEquivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by\nformal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting\nmethods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of\nMiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.",

While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.\nFirst, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task\ntypes), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving\nperformance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of\ndomains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via\nR&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity\n(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data\ncomposition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients\nobtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for\nadditional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or\ngradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and\nprovide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to\nnon-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and\nmultimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B\nmatches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.",

In version one of the benchmark,\npresented here, we have calibrated the complexity of the benchmark test cases\nto ensure that the SOTA (State of the Art) agents (at the time of publication)\ndo not achieve results higher than 50%, while the average white collar worker\ncan perform all these tasks with perfect accuracy. The benchmark can be scored\nmanually, but we also introduce an automated validation mechanism that has an\naverage error rate less than 2%. Therefore, this benchmark presents solid\nground for fully automated measuring of progress, capabilities and the\neffectiveness of GUI-navigation AI agents over the short and medium-term\nhorizon.
