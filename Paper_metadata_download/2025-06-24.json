      "summary": "In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative\nmodel designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,\nincluding text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike\nOmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image\nmodalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism\ntailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset\nbased on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels in terms of consistency.

    "summary": "In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative\nmodel designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,\nincluding text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike\nOmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image\nmodalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data.

      "summary": "Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded\nscenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum\ngeneration length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length\nincreases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

In this paper,\nwe introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive\nuser profiles.

Instead, we employ\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with\ntask-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and\neffective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user\nprofiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their\nimpact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation\nthrough pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation\naccuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness.

By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating\ndirect feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the\nrigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with\ntask-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and\neffective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user\nprofiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their\nimpact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation\nthrough pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation\naccuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness. This work enhances profile\ngeneration as a key innovation for next-generation recommendation systems.",

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across\nmultiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse\nconditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)\nmethod, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate\nconsistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the\nnext-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its\neffectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating\nwidely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract\neffective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that\naccommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training\nstrategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection\nmodules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal\nconditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This\nstrategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to\nenhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through\nthe randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the\noverfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the\n\"Shuffle View\" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the\ntraining data by several magnitudes.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring\nlong context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory\nbottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.
