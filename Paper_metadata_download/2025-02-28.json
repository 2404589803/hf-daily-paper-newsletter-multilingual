      "summary": "We study self-rewarding reasoning large language models (LLMs), which can\nsimultaneously generate step-by-step reasoning and evaluate the correctness of\ntheir outputs during the inference time-without external feedback. This\nintegrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning\nprocess, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We\nparticularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models\nautonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when\nto terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a\ntwo-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning\nmodels using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential\nrejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that\nincorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning\nmodels on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of\nself-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the\nmodels' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through\nreinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and\nQwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction\ncapabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on\nexternal reward models.",

      "summary": "In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities\n(e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language\nmodels (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on\nchallenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by\nreplacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides\nrich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse\ndownstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its\nrouter, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for\neach input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always\nproduce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap,\nwe propose a novel and efficient method \"Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that\nlocally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it\ntoward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of\nthe test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization\nobjectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves\nstate-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks,\nwithout training any base-model parameters.",

      "summary": "Reasoning is a critical frontier for advancing medical image analysis, where\ntransparency and trustworthiness play a central role in both clinician trust\nand regulatory approval. Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show\npromise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers\nwithout revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce\nMedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning\nto enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training\ndistributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover\nhuman-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references.\nDespite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model\nparameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI,\nCT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million\nsamples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under\nout-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit\nreasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable\nAI in clinical practice.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark\nfor fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be\ndecomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of\nintermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state\nchecking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models\nassess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader\nresearch, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance\non general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state\nchecking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1%\non GSM8K.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in\nsoftware engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving\ncode knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party\nlibrary APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets,\noften results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety\nand efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for\nidentifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge\nupdates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop\nCODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay\nsynchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs\nfrom six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three\nevaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of\n2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs\nreveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of\nadvanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe\nthat our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more\neffective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future. The\nexperimental code and dataset are publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/Lucky-voyage/Code-Sync.",

      "summary": "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with\nhuman preferences. It requires joint training of an actor and critic with a\npretrained, fixed reward model for guidance. This approach increases\ncomputational complexity and instability due to actor-critic interdependence.\nAdditionally, PPO lacks access to true environment rewards in LLM tasks,\nlimiting its adaptability. Under such conditions, pretraining a value model or\na reward model becomes equivalent, as both provide fixed supervisory signals\nwithout new ground-truth feedback. To address these issues, we propose\nDecoupled Value Policy Optimization (DVPO), a lean framework that\nreplaces traditional reward modeling with a pretrained global value model\n(GVM). The GVM is conditioned on policy trajectories and predicts token-level\nreturn-to-go estimates. By decoupling value model from policy training (via\nfrozen GVM-driven RL objectives), DVPO eliminates actor-critic interdependence,\nreducing GPU memory usage by 40\\% and training time by 35\\% compared to\nconventional RLHF. Experiments across benchmarks show DVPO outperforms\nefficient RLHF methods (e.g., DPO) while matching state-of-the-art PPO in\nperformance.",

      "summary": "The representation disparity between visual generation and understanding\nimposes a critical gap in integrating these capabilities into a single\nframework. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniTok, a discrete visual tokenizer\nthat encodes fine-grained details for generation while also capturing\nhigh-level semantics for understanding. Despite recent studies have shown that\nthese objectives could induce loss conflicts in training, we reveal that the\nunderlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete\ntokens. We address this by introducing multi-codebook quantization, which\ndivides vector quantization with several independent sub-codebooks to expand\nthe latent feature space, while avoiding training instability caused by\noverlarge codebooks. Our method significantly raises the upper limit of unified\ndiscrete tokenizers to match or even surpass domain-specific continuous\ntokenizers. For instance, UniTok achieves a remarkable rFID of 0.38 (versus\n0.87 for SD-VAE) and a zero-shot accuracy of 78.6% (versus 76.2% for CLIP) on\nImageNet.

      "summary": "We present Mobius, a novel method to generate seamlessly looping videos from\ntext descriptions directly without any user annotations, thereby creating new\nvisual materials for the multi-media presentation. Our method repurposes the\npre-trained video latent diffusion model for generating looping videos from\ntext prompts without any training. During inference, we first construct a\nlatent cycle by connecting the starting and ending noise of the videos. Given\nthat the temporal consistency can be maintained by the context of the video\ndiffusion model, we perform multi-frame latent denoising by gradually shifting\nthe first-frame latent to the end in each step. As a result, the denoising\ncontext varies in each step while maintaining consistency throughout the\ninference process. Moreover, the latent cycle in our method can be of any\nlength. This extends our latent-shifting approach to generate seamless looping\nvideos beyond the scope of the video diffusion model's context. Unlike previous\ncinemagraphs, the proposed method does not require an image as appearance,\nwhich will restrict the motions of the generated results. Instead, our method\ncan produce more dynamic motion and better visual quality. We conduct multiple\nexperiments and comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method,\ndemonstrating its efficacy in different scenarios. All the code will be made\navailable.",

      "summary": "Mainstream issue-resolving frameworks predominantly rely on commercial\nmodels, leading to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing training\napproaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to\nfully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented\nReinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue\nresolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured\nsubtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code\nedit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled\nsupervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using\nground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement\nlearning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the\nSoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve\n21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B). The experimental\nresults demonstrate that SoRFT significantly enhances issue-resolving\nperformance, improves model generalization, and provides a cost-efficient\nalternative to commercial models.",

      "summary": "The field of advanced text-to-image generation is witnessing the emergence of\nunified frameworks that integrate powerful text encoders, such as CLIP and T5,\nwith Diffusion Transformer backbones. Although there have been efforts to\ncontrol output images with additional conditions, like canny and depth map, a\ncomprehensive framework for arbitrary text-image interleaved control is still\nlacking. This gap is especially evident when attempting to merge concepts or\nvisual elements from multiple images in the generation process. To mitigate the\ngap, we conducted preliminary experiments showing that large multimodal models\n(LMMs) offer an effective shared representation space, where image and text can\nbe well-aligned to serve as a condition for external diffusion models. Based on\nthis discovery, we propose Dream Engine, an efficient and unified framework\ndesigned for arbitrary text-image interleaved control in image generation\nmodels. Building on powerful text-to-image models like SD3.5, we replace the\noriginal text-only encoders by incorporating versatile multimodal information\nencoders such as QwenVL. Our approach utilizes a two-stage training paradigm,\nconsisting of joint text-image alignment and multimodal interleaved instruction\ntuning. Our experiments demonstrate that this training method is effective,\nachieving a 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark, and matching the\nperformance of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like SD3.5 and FLUX.",

This paper\nintroduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time\nreasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned\nCoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations:\n(1) extending reasoning-based translation beyond MT sub-tasks to six languages\nand diverse tasks (e.g., legal/medical domain adaptation, idiom resolution);\n(2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human\nstrategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3)\nenabling self-evolving CoT discovery and anti-forgetting adaptation through RL\nwith KL-constrained rewards. Experimental results indicate a steady translation\nperformance improvement in 21 languages and 80 translation directions on\nFlores-101 test set, especially on the 15 languages unseen from training, with\nits general multilingual abilities preserved compared with plain SFT.",
