      "summary": "Although contemporary text-to-image generation models have achieved\nremarkable breakthroughs in producing visually appealing images, their capacity\nto generate precise and flexible typographic elements, especially non-Latin\nalphabets, remains constrained. To address these limitations, we start from an\nnaive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for\ntext rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present\nRepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation\nmodels with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate,\nmultilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really\nunderstand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and\nadditionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to\nenable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text\ncontent, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text\nperceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to\nstabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize\nwith noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region\nmasks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid\ndistortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the\neffectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach\noutperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to\nnative multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also\nexhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.",

However,\ndisentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL\nCIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed\nfrom classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the\nin-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering\nEnglish sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there\nis a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This\nbijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task\nin some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question\nif LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires\ndeciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL\nCIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,\nproviding a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is\nsmall, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.\nFinally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in\ntheir ability to decode the ciphered inputs.",

However,\ndisentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL\nCIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed\nfrom classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the\nin-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering\nEnglish sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there\nis a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This\nbijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task\nin some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question\nif LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires\ndeciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL\nCIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,\nproviding a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is\nsmall, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.\nFinally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in\ntheir ability to decode the ciphered inputs.",
