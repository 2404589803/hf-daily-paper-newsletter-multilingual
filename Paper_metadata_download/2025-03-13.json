To mitigate this challenge, we note that\nthe reverse process of diffusion exhibits an inherent entropy-reducing nature.\nGiven the inter-frame redundancy in video modality, maintaining full frame\nrates in high-entropy stages is unnecessary. Based on this insight, we propose\nTPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By\ndividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases\nframe rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on\nfull frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the\nmulti-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework:\nstage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our\ntraining strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances\ntraining efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the\ngenerality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x\nimprovement in inference efficiency.",

In essence,\nReangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An\nimage-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a\nself-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped\nvideos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame\nof the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives\nunder an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R,\ngenerating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on\nstatic view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video\nsurpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video\ngeneration.

In this work, we introduce WildIFEval - a large-scale dataset of 12K\nreal user instructions with diverse, multi-constraint conditions. Unlike prior\ndatasets, our collection spans a broad lexical and topical spectrum of\nconstraints, in natural user prompts. We categorize these constraints into\neight high-level classes to capture their distribution and dynamics in\nreal-world scenarios. Leveraging WildIFEval, we conduct extensive experiments\nto benchmark the instruction-following capabilities of leading LLMs. Our\nfindings reveal that all evaluated models experience performance degradation\nwith an increasing number of constraints. Thus, we show that all models have a\nlarge room for improvement on such tasks. Moreover, we observe that the\nspecific type of constraint plays a critical role in model performance.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Single-Cell MultiModal Generative Pre-trained\nTransformer (scMMGPT), a unified PLM for joint cell and text modeling. scMMGPT\neffectively integrates the state-of-the-art cell and text PLMs, facilitating\ncross-modal knowledge sharing for improved performance. To bridge the text-cell\nmodality gap, scMMGPT leverages dedicated cross-modal projectors, and undergoes\nextensive pre-training on 27 million cells -- the largest dataset for\nmultimodal cell-text PLMs to date. This large-scale pre-training enables\nscMMGPT to excel in joint cell-text tasks, achieving an 84\\% relative\nimprovement of textual discrepancy for cell description generation, 20.5\\%\nhigher accuracy for cell type annotation, and 4\\% improvement in k-NN\naccuracy for text-conditioned pseudo-cell generation, outperforming baselines.",
